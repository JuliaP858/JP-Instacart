# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

## Objective

The objective of this project is to perform a detailed analysis of Instacart's sales data to uncover insights and patterns related to customer purchasing behavior. The goal is to support the marketing and sales teams by providing strategies for better customer segmentation and targeted advertising based on the insights derived from the data.

## Project Context

Instacart is an online grocery delivery platform that operates through an app. Despite strong sales, the company seeks a deeper understanding of its customer base and purchasing trends to implement more effective marketing campaigns. This project will explore the following key areas:

Identifying the busiest days and times for orders.
Analyzing spending patterns during different times of the day.
Grouping products into price ranges to direct marketing efforts.
Understanding the popularity of product categories and departments.
Profiling customers based on loyalty, region, age, family status, and other demographic factors.
The analysis will help stakeholders refine their targeted marketing campaigns and improve product recommendations, ultimately driving sales growth.

## Tools Used

This project relies on the following tools and technologies:

Python: Core language for data analysis.
Jupyter Notebooks: For conducting the analysis and visualizations.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Used for numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
SciPy: For additional data processing and statistical analysis.
Anaconda: Python distribution for package and environment management.
Excel: For report generation and sharing results with stakeholders.

## Data

The analysis uses open-source data sets from Instacart, available through Kaggle, and a custom customer dataset. The data includes various aspects such as order history, product details, customer demographics, and purchasing behaviors.

## Key Data Sets:

Instacart Data Sets: Publicly available data on customer orders, product departments, and sales transactions.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
Data visualization to communicate findings clearly to stakeholders.
Deriving new variables for deeper insights (e.g., customer loyalty flags).
Grouping and aggregating data for summary statistics.
Ethical handling of data, particularly with regard to customer information.

## Deliverables

Exploratory Analysis: Detailed analysis of order behaviors, customer segmentation, product popularity, and sales trends.

Visualizations: At least four types of visualizations (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots, histograms) to present key insights.

Final Report: A comprehensive report summarizing the analysis, methodology, insights, and recommendations for marketing and sales strategies.
